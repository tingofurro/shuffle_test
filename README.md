## Datasets

We perform Shuffle tests in three domains: news (Wall Street Journal standard dataset), legal (based on the Billsum dataset), and stories (based on the Reddit TIFU dataset). Data loaders are provided in the `utils_dataset.py` file [(link)](https://github.com/tingofurro/shuffle_test/blob/main/utils_dataset.py).

## Scripts

We provide the scripts to reproduce experimental results:
- `run_supervised.py`: is script to run the supervised `GPT2-large` model we finetuned on the binary classification task of "is shuffle".
- `run_gpt2_zeroshot.py`: is the script to run the zero-shot NLG models of the GPT2 type. It can be used to run various sizes of GPT2 architectures (base, medium, large).
- `run_bidir_zeroshot.py`: is the script to run NLU models of the BERT type. It can be used to run the `bert-base-uncased` and `roberta-base` experiments from the paper.
